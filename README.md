# LightCurve Challenge

### Problem 1 - Secure Smart Contracts
The findings are presented in the README.md file. The suggestions made in the audit are implemented Improved.sol. Wrote a fuzz test example, but not impactful from an audit prespective.

### Problem 2 - Biconomy
##### Part A - SDK V3
Using the Multichain Validation Module to deploy to polygon mumbai and ethereum goerli. Unfortunately there is an error of needing to specific transaction parameters so only the polygon transaction went through.

The deploy address is: 0xCd9a629a04af41142e987c609AF5FF871eDcBFFF

##### Part B - Custom Module

Standalone module to limit spend and transaction rates. Compiles successfully but untested due to time constraints.
